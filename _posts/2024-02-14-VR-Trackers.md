# Slime VR Trackers

## Introduction

There is a project called [SlimeVR](https://docs.slimevr.dev/), its an open source VR full body tracker (FBT). The general diy solution is to buy the individual parts and assemble them yourself. I have built a set of trackers this way and they work amazingly but I wanted to create a neat all in one package. When I started I did look for anyone who had done this, but I only found boards to mount daughter boards to. There are now loads of different people doing the same thing, and probably better but this project has allowed me to learn how to design PCBs correctly and design around them using Fusion360 and has generally been a good learning experience.

I wanted to design a PCB that would allow me to get the entire board manufactured as a single unit rather than buying each breakout board for the components and soldering them together. This post is about the problems I faced during the research and development of the whole project, which essentially involved me reading datasheets and copying the example circuits. In the following blog post I will talk about issues I had, the solutions I came up with and a general reflection of the the entire project.
