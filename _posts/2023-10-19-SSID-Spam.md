# About Project

The point of the project was to have a little fun while learning about how to use the ESP-12E. Also, to help with the boredom of my course. The idea is that it has a series of pre-set SSIDs and changes between them every 2 minutes. I also decided to add a captive portal to it for shits and giggles.

If you look at the code for the project, its got some funny ones jabbing at my college, and some taking the piss out of the UK government.

```cpp
const char ssid0[32] = "I really hate Rishi Sunak";
const char ssid1[32] = "I really hate Liz Truss";
const char ssid2[32] = "I really hate the T-Level";
const char ssid3[32] = "TRANS RIGHTS!!!!";
const char ssid4[32] = "LCC WiFi really is shit";
const char ssid5[32] = "Digit's probs down atm";
const char ssid6[32] = "WasItWorthSellingOutToCoptrz?";
const char ssid7[32] = "Who am I?";
const char ssid8[32] = "The Gov is corrupt";
const char ssid9[32] = "TheToriesDon'tcareaboutyou";
const char ssid10[32] = "The Chips Here Are Tasty";
const char ssid11[32] = "TRANSRIGHTS!!!!";
const char ssid12[32] = "TheGovOnlySupportsItsAgenda";
```
