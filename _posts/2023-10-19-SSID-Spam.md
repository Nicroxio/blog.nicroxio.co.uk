# About Project

The purpose of the project was to have a bit of fun while learning how to use the ESP-12E. It also helped with the boredom created by my course. The idea is that it has a series of preset SSIDs and changes between them every 2 minutes it also has a captive portal to display any small webpage you want.

If you examine the code for the project, it includes some dumb SSIDs. Of course, you can change them to whatever you want, assuming they are fewer than 32 characters.

## OTA Programming

Recently, I decided to add Over The Air programming to the project. I encountered issues initially because the GIF on the webpage, while funny, was massive and was consuming all 4KB of memory on the tiny ESP8266 12E module. So, I converted the GIF to a webm format, compressing it enough to allow for OTA. I also needed to add the ability for it to connect to WiFi because as soon as any OTA commands are received, it shuts off its ability to serve as an access point.

```cpp
const char ssid0[32] = "It Burns When IP";
const char ssid1[32] = "FBI Surveillance Van #404";
const char ssid2[32] = "Drop It Like It's Hotspot";
const char ssid3[32] = "Pretty Fly for a Wi-Fi";
const char ssid4[32] = "404 Wi-Fi Not Found";
const char ssid5[32] = "Hide Yo Kids, Hide Yo Wi-Fi";
const char ssid6[32] = "The Promised LAN";
const char ssid7[32] = "This LAN Is My LAN";
const char ssid8[32] = "No Free Wi-Fi For You";
const char ssid9[32] = "Silence of the LANs";
const char ssid10[32] = "Get Off My LAN!";
const char ssid11[32] = "The Internet Is Lava";
const char ssid12[32] = "I'm Under Your Bed";
```
