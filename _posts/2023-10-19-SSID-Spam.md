# About Project

The point of the project was to have a little fun while learning about how to use the ESP-12E. Also, to help with the boredom of my course. The idea is that it has a series of pre-set SSIDs and changes between them every 2 minutes. I also decided to add a captive portal to it for shits and giggles.

If you look at the code for the project, its got some stupid SSID's ofc you can change them to whatever you want assuming its lower than 32 characters

```cpp
const char ssid0[32] = "It Burns When IP";
const char ssid1[32] = "FBI Surveillance Van #404";
const char ssid2[32] = "Drop It Like It's Hotspot";
const char ssid3[32] = "Pretty Fly for a Wi-Fi";
const char ssid4[32] = "404 Wi-Fi Not Found";
const char ssid5[32] = "Hide Yo Kids, Hide Yo Wi-Fi";
const char ssid6[32] = "The Promised LAN";
const char ssid7[32] = "This LAN Is My LAN";
const char ssid8[32] = "No Free Wi-Fi For You";
const char ssid9[32] = "Silence of the LANs";
const char ssid10[32] = "Get Off My LAN!";
const char ssid11[32] = "The Internet Is Lava";
const char ssid12[32] = "I'm Under Your Bed";
```
